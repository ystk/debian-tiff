Description: Tag Image File Format library (TIFF), alternative development files
 This package is a temporary package designed to make it possible for
 packages to use features in libtiff5, such as bigtiff, while still

 a requirement to have both libtiff5-dev files and libtiff4-dev files
 installed on your system at the same time.  See README.Debian for
 additional information.
